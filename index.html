        What is Sass? That's the question we here to answer. If you're new to web design, 
        you've probably heard the term floating around, but you might not be quite up to 
        speed with exactly what Sass is, what is does, and whether or not you should be 
        using it. In short, Sass is a CSS preprocessor, which adds special features such 
        as variables, nested rules and mixins (sometimes referred to as syntactic sugar) 
        into regular CSS. The aim is to make the coding process simpler and more efficient.
        Let's explore in more detail.

        What is a CSS preprocessor?
    </h2>
    <p class="nText">
        A CSS preprocessor is a scripting language that extends CSS by allowing developers 
        to write code in one language and then compile it into CSS. Sass is perhaps the most 
        popular preprocessor around right now, but other well-known examples include Less 
        and Stylus.

        Before we go any further, a quick public service announcement is in order: most web 
        designers would say that if you're new to CSS, you're better off avoiding Sass 
        (or any preprocessors, extensions or frameworks) while you're still learning. While 
        it's true they offer many advantages in speed and efficiency, it's important that 
        you really get to grips with the basics of CSS. Make sure you learn the core 
        concepts before you start exploring shortcuts and confusing things.

        What is Sass?

        <b>
            Sass is arguably the most useful of all CSS extensions
        </b>
        Sass (which stands for 'Syntactically awesome style sheets) is an extension of CSS 
        that enables you to use things like variables, nested rules, inline imports and more.
        It also helps to keep things organised and allows you to create style sheets faster.
        
        Sass is compatible with all versions of CSS. The only requirement for using it 
        is that you must have Ruby installed. Users are also asked to follow the Sass 
        Community Guidelines.
        How to use Sass       
        In the following section, we'll outline some basic tips for using Sass, using 
        examples from the official Sass website. Take a look at the Sass Documentation 
        for additional references and examples. 
    </p>
    <h2 class="topic">
        Syntax
    </h2>
    <p class="nText">
        <b>
            Sass includes two syntax options:
        </b>
        <li>
            SCSS (Sassy CSS): Uses the .scss file extension and is fully compliant 
            with CSS syntax
        </li>
        <li>
            Indented (simply called 'Sass'): Uses .sass file extension and indentation 
            rather than brackets; it is not fully compliant with CSS syntax, but it's 
            quicker to write
        </li>
        <i>
            Note that files can be converted from one syntax to the other using the 
            sass-convert command.
        </i>
    </p>
    <h2 class="topic">
        Variables
    </h2>
    <p class="nText">
        Just like other programming languages, Sass allows the use of variables that can 
        store information you can use throughout your style sheet. For example, you can 
        store a colour value in a variable at the top of the file, and then use this 
        variable when setting the colour of your elements. This enables you to quickly 
        change your colours without having to modify each line separately.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>
            For example:
        </b>
    </p>
    <p class="code">
        $font-stack:    Helvetica, sans-serif;
        $primary-color: #333;

        body {
        font: 100% $font-stack;
        color: $primary-color;
        }

        The following CSS will be produced:

        body {
        font: 100% Helvetica, sans-serif;
        color: #333;
        }
    </p>
    <h2>
        Nesting
    </h2>
    <p class="nText">
        Nesting is a double-edged sword. While it provides an excellent method for reducing 
        the amount of code you need to write, it can also lead to over-qualified CSS if not 
        executed carefully. The idea is to nest your CSS selectors in such a way as to mimic 
        your HTML hierarchy.
    </p>
    <p class="nText">
        The following shows a basic navigation style that uses nesting:
    </p>
    <p class="code">
        nav {
            ul {
              margin: 0;
              padding: 0;
              list-style: none;
            }
          
            li { display: inline-block; }
          
            a {
              display: block;
              padding: 6px 12px;
              text-decoration: none;
            }
          }
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>
            The CSS output is as follows:
        </b>
    </p>
    <p class="code">
        nav ul {
            margin: 0;
            padding: 0;
            list-style: none;
          }
          
          nav li {
            display: inline-block;
          }
          
          nav a {
            display: block;
            padding: 6px 12px;
            text-decoration: none;
          }          
    </p>
</body>
