        What is Sass? That's the question we here to answer. If you're new to web design, 
        you've probably heard the term floating around, but you might not be quite up to 
        speed with exactly what Sass is, what is does, and whether or not you should be 
        using it. In short, Sass is a CSS preprocessor, which adds special features such 
        as variables, nested rules and mixins (sometimes referred to as syntactic sugar) 
        into regular CSS. The aim is to make the coding process simpler and more efficient.
        Let's explore in more detail.

        What is a CSS preprocessor?
    </h2>
    <p class="nText">
        A CSS preprocessor is a scripting language that extends CSS by allowing developers 
        to write code in one language and then compile it into CSS. Sass is perhaps the most 
        popular preprocessor around right now, but other well-known examples include Less 
        and Stylus.

        Before we go any further, a quick public service announcement is in order: most web 
        designers would say that if you're new to CSS, you're better off avoiding Sass 
        (or any preprocessors, extensions or frameworks) while you're still learning. While 
        it's true they offer many advantages in speed and efficiency, it's important that 
        you really get to grips with the basics of CSS. Make sure you learn the core 
        concepts before you start exploring shortcuts and confusing things.
